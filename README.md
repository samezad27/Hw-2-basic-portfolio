### User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them -- done
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation 
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section -- done
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications -- done
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others -- done
WHEN I click on the images of the applications 
THEN I am taken to that deployed application -- these projects haven't been completed yet but I will link them as we complete them throughout the course
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport -- done
